# As If Wardrobe
## Elevator Pitch
Growing up, every girl dreamed of having Cher’s closet from the 1995 chick flick, Clueless. Not only her wardrobe but her closet app as well. As If Outfits brings this pretend 90’s application to life in a modern way. Staying through to the 90’s theme depicted in the film, this web service allows one to plan outfits seamlessly without sorting through a wardrobe manually, being able to plan out outfits throughout the week, with assistance in knowing what would look good together. Not only this, but As If Outfits also allows your friends to vote on different options when deciding on an outfit for a special occasion, or every day.
